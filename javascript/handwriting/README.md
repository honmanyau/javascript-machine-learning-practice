## Introduction

This is a classification exercise for handwriting recognition and is based on the TensorFlow.js tutorial [Training on Images: Recognizing Handwritten Digits with a Convolutional Neural Network](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist.html).

## Dataset

None (well, at least not at the time this exercise started)! Data will be generated manually to begin with. Any generated data that is stored will be noted.

## Data Generation

The data used is all generated manually using an HTML `<canvas>` element that can be written on and the corresponding details are discussed below.

### Getting Handwriting as Input

The `<canvas>` element that is used to get handwriting inputs for this exercise is reasonably trivial to set up; a [prototype](https://codepen.io/honmanyau/pen/OoOMQR) was initially made on CodePen.
